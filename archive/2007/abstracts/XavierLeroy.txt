Title:
Industrial uses of Caml: examples and lessons learned from the smart
card industry

Speaker:
Xavier Leroy, INRIA

Abstract:
The first part of this talk will show some examples of uses of Caml in
industrial contexts, especially at companies that are part of the Caml
consortium.  The second part discusses my personal experience at the
Trusted Logic start-up company, developing high-security software
components for smart cards.  While technological limitations prevent
running functional languages on such low-resource systems, the
development and certification of smart card software present a number
of challenges where functional programming can help.

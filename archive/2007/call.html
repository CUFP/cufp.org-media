Functional Programming As a <em>Means</em>, Not an <em>End</em>

</h3>
<HR>

<p>
Functional languages have been under academic development for over 25
years, and remain fertile ground for programming language research.
Recently, however, developers in industrial, governmental, and open
source projects have begun to use functional languages very
successfully in practical applications.  In these settings, functional
programming has often provided dramatic leverage, including whole new
ways of thinking about the original problem.
</p>

<p>
The goal of the CUFP workshop is to act as a voice for these users of
functional languages.  The workshop supports the increasing viability
of functional programming in the commercial, governmental, and
open-source space by providing a forum for FP professionals to share
their experiences and ideas, whether those ideas are related to
business, management, or engineering. The workshop is also designed to
enable the formation and reinforcement of relationships that further
the commercial use of functional languages. Providing user feedback to
language designers and implementors is not a primary goal of the
workshop, though it will be welcome if it occurs.
</p>

<p>

<a name="submit"><h3>Speaking at CUFP</h3></a>
If you use functional programming as a means, rather than as an end,
we invite you to offer to give a talk at the workshop.   Alternatively,
if you know someone who would give a good talk, please nominate them!
</p>

<p>
Talks are typically about 30-45 minutes long, but can be shorter.  They aim
to inform participants about how functional programming played out in
real-world applications, focusing especially on the re-usable lessons
learned, or insights gained.  Your talk does not need to be
highly technical; for this audience, reflections on the commercial,
management, or software engineering aspects are, if anything, more
important.  You do not need to submit a paper!
</p>

<p>

If you are interested in offering a talk, or nominating someone to do
so, send an e-mail to <i>kfisher at research.att.com</i> or <i>simonpj
at microsoft.com</i> by <b>June 1, 2007</b> with a short description
of what you'd like to talk about or what you think your nominee should
give a talk about.  Such descriptions should be roughly a page in
length.
</p>

<h3>Program plans</h3>

CUFP 2007 will last a full day, with a mix of invited and submitted
presentations, as well as discussion sessions.  Topics will range over
a wide area, including:
<ul>
     <li> Case studies of successful and unsuccessful uses of functional programming;
     <li> Business opportunities and risks from using functional languages;
     <li> Enablers for functional language use in a commercial setting;
     <li> Barriers to the adoption of functional languages, and
     <li> Mitigation strategies for overcoming limitations of FP.
</ul>

There will be no published proceedings, as the meeting is intended to be
more a discussion forum than a technical interchange.
</p>

Reports of the first two CUFP workshops appeared in the Functional
Programming column of the December 2004 issue of SIGPLAN Notices.  The
CUFP 2004 report

   Functional languages have been under academic development for 
   over 25 years, and remain fertile ground for programming language 
   research. Recently, however, developers in industrial,
   governmental, and open source projects have begun to use 
   functional programming successfully in practical applications. 
   In these settings, functional programming has often provided 
   dramatic leverage, including whole new ways of thinking about the 
   original problem.

   The goal of the CUFP workshop is to act as a voice for these users
   of functional programming. The workshop supports the increasing 
   viability of functional programming in the commercial,
   governmental, and open-source space by providing a forum for 
   professionals to share their experiences and ideas, whether those 
   ideas are related to business, management, or engineering. The 
   workshop is also designed to enable the formation and reinforcement 
   of relationships that further the commercial use of functional 
   programming. Providing user feedback to language designers and 
   implementors is not a primary goal of the workshop, though it will
   be welcome if it occurs.

    <b>Why Microsoft is Investing in Functional Programming</b>
  </a>
  <br>
  <b>Speaker:</b>
  <em><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~dsyme/"
  target="_blank">Don Syme</a></em>,
  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com" target="_blank">Microsoft</a>
  <br>
  <b>Abstract:</b> Over the last 10 years Microsoft have made
  investments in programming technologies strongly influenced by
  functional programming techniques and languages, from generics in C#
  2.0, LINQ in .NET 3.5 and futures in the .NET Parallel Extensions
  Library. Most recently Microsoft has announced that it is bringing
  F#, a functional/OO language for .NET, to product quality, as well
  as continuing its research investments in both Haskell and
  foundational language techniques.</p>
<p>This talk will take a look at these developments and why Microsoft
  is making these investments.  We will focus on F# in particular:
  where does F# fit in the spectrum of Microsoft development tools?
  What kind of tasks is F# fashioned for? How has F# grown up over the
  years to be influenced by OCaml, C#, Haskell, Python and other
  languages? We'll look at these and other questions as we explore one
  of the many ways in which research and practice have come together
  over the last 10 years at Microsoft.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A
  separate <a href="http://www.deinprogramm.de/defun-2008/"
  target="_blank">DEFUN</a> tutorial on F# will allow you to take a
  hands-on look at the more technical side of the language.</p>

    <b>Minimizing the &ldquo;Immune Response&rdquo; 
      to Functional Programming</b>
  </a>
  <br>
  <b>Speaker:</b>
  <em>David Balaban</em>,
  <a href="http://www.amgen.com/" target="_blank">Amgen</a>
  <br>
  <b>Contributors:</b>
  <em>David Balaban</em> &amp; <em>Darrell Lewis-Sandy</em>,
  <a href="http://www.amgen.com/" target="_blank">Amgen</a>
  <br>
  <b>Abstract:</b> 
  Functional programming was introduced at Amgen for three main reasons: 
  <ul>
    <li>To rapidly build software to implement mathematical models and
      other complex, mathematically oriented applications</li>
    <li>Provide a more mathematically rigorous validation of software</li>
    <li>To break developers out of their software development rut by
      giving them a new way to think about software.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>Our experience is that using functional programming reduces the
  critical conceptual distance between thought/algorithm design and
  code. In several projects, we have been able to develop code quickly
  and to verify &#8212; to an applied mathematician's satisfaction
  &#8212; the correctness of Haskell code straightforwardly; we have
  yet to achieve this with more traditional mainstream languages. In
  several cases, the Haskell code has evolved quickly, matching the
  pace at which our understanding of the underlying problems has
  evolved.
</p>
<p>We have found that many of the informatics staff are enthusiastic
  about and inspired by this approach, even though many have not yet
  begun to apply Haskell in their routine work. On the other hand,
  those developers who have a more traditional approach to software
  development may view our prodding toward a more mathematical
  approach to thinking about algorithms and programming with
  scepticism. For these staff, our prodding toward a more mathematical
  approach to thinking about algorithms and programming is viewed as a
  distraction at best and often produces a genuine intellectual immune
  response.</p>
<p>We will illustrate the places where functional programming has been
  useful to us with examples from pharmacodynamics and supply chain
  management. These will show, for example, how lazy evaluation can
  greatly simplify the coding of a complex simulation.  We will also
  describe plans to expand the use of functional programming with
  additional training classes and recruitment strategies that may make
  it easier to find people with deep functional programming experience
  and applied mathematics skills.

    <b>The Mobile Messaging Gateway,</b>
    <b>from Idea to Prototype to Launch in 12 Months</b>
  </a>
  <br>
  <b>Speaker:</b>
  <em>Francesco Cesarini</em>,
  <a href="http://www.erlang-consulting.com/" target="_blank">Erlang
  Training and Consulting</a>
  <br>
  <b>Abstract:</b> What might not be obvious from our company name and
    our website is the fact that our fastest growing business segment
    is in house software development on behalf of third parties,
    keeping well over a third of our staff busy. In early 2007, we
    were awarded a major contract to build a generic multi service /
    community mobile instant messaging gateway.
</p>
<p>More and more operators have started re- routing IP related traffic
   through gateways. The advantages in using gateways include
   authentication & authorization, billing, data compression,
   optimised communication protocols and control over the clients
   being used. It also facilitates support and maintenance, providing
   a single point of entrance for all IP related services.
</p>
<p>The talk will describe how we convinced the client to bet on Erlang
   and Functional Programming and go ahead with our solution. It will
   cover the challenges we faced as an organisation, most specifically
   on testing and verification, getting our client to migrate from
   waterfall models to agile development and an ever changing list of
   requirements. The project was a challenge, not technically, as
   Erlang was the right choice, but from an organizational point of
   view, as it allowed us to double in size over 12 months. What was
   really challenged were our organisational and logistical skills,
   taking us form a company in start-up phase to a mature organisation
   capable of handling the growth.
</p>
<p>A part of the talk is dedicated to stress testing Erlang on
   multi-core, and the difficulties in making the system run at 100%
   CPU. It concludes with many of the myths of Erlang, urban legends
   which are not true when dealing with true product development.

    <b>From OCaml to Javascript at Skydeck</b>
  </a>
  <br>
  <b>Speaker:</b>
  <em>Jake Donham</em>, 
  <a href="http://skydeck.com/" target="_blank">Skydeck</a>
  <br>
  <b>Abstract:</b> Skydeck is a startup software company building a
  service to help consumers manage their cell phones online. From the
  beginning we have used OCaml as our primary language for software
  development.
</p>
<p>
  A key piece of our system is a Firefox extension that imports cell
  phone bills and phone usage data from phone carrier web
  sites. Firefox extensions are written in Javascript; to speed our
  development we wrote OCamljs, a Javascript back-end to the OCaml
  compiler. Using OCamljs we get the benefits of OCaml's
  expressiveness and compile-time typechecking, the use of
  OCaml-specific tools like OCamlbuild and Camlp4, and easier
  integration with our OCaml server infrastructure. In particular,
  OCamljs lets us make and deploy changes very quickly with
  confidence.
</p>
<p>
  This talk will describe OCamljs and how we use it at Skydeck, and
  reflect briefly on the wisdom of using an atypical language at a
  startup.

  <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/" target="_blank">Yahoo</a>
  <br>
  <b>Abstract:</b> Yahoo is no stranger to functional programming
  languages. It has had significant products in languages like Lisp
  and Scheme. Somehow Erlang, and other function languages, are often
  overlooked when most developers are researching various problems and
  systems. This is very unfortunate given the power and flexibility
  that these languages provide.

  At Yahoo there are places where functional languages and make a
  phenomenal difference in the way problems and solutions are
  approached. This presentation will cover how Erlang, a powerful and
  flexible functional language, gave us exactly what we needed at a
  critical time and how it was approached as a production language at
  Yahoo.

    <b>Controlling Hybrid Vehicles with Haskell</b>
  </a>
  <br>
  <b>Speaker:</b>
  <em><a href="http://www.funhdl.org" target="_blank">Tom Hawkins</a></em>,
  <a href="http://www.eaton.com/" target="_blank">Eaton Corporation</a>
  <br>
  <b>Abstract:</b> To address environmental concerns and rising fuel
  prices, Eaton is developing a family of hydraulic hybrid systems to
  increase fuel economy for heavy duty trucks.  Hydraulic hybrids work
  much the same as their electric hybrid counterparts.  Instead of an
  electric motor and battery, hydraulic hybrids use pumps, valves, and
  accumulators to capture and return a vehicle's kinetic energy.  Most
  of these components are under direct software control, and, due to
  the nature of the application, often require a high level of safety.
  By using functional languages, we are able to intuitively describe
  safety critical behavior of the system, thus lowering the chance of
  introducing bugs in the design phase.  Our experimental environment
  uses a Haskell DSL called Atom, which compiles a program of atomic
  state transition rules into a form that can be flashed onto a
  vehicle's electronic control unit (ECU).  With proper rule
  scheduling, Atom can transform a multi-task, multi-rate program into
  a single thread of execution, thereby eliminating the need for
  run-time scheduling, context switching, and inter-process
  communication.  We coin this &ldquo;RTOS Synthesis&rdquo; as it does
  most of the work of a real-time operating system, but with
  compile-time guarantees as opposed to run-time exceptions.

  <a href="http://www.mochimedia.com/" target="_blank">Mochimedia</a>
  <br>
  <b>Abstract:</b> We've been using Erlang at Mochi Media since the
  2006 launch of MochiAds, our advertising platform for Flash
  games. It's the first time any of us have done any production
  software with a functional programming language, and thus far it's
  turned out to be a great experience. The success of the MochiAds
  platform led us to writing many other products (internal and
  external) on the same technology stack. We believe Erlang to be one
  of the key reasons why we're able to develop more quickly and scale
  more easily than our competitors.

  <b>Abstract:</b> XenServer is a virtualization product that offers
  near bare-metal virtualization performance for virtualized server
  and desktop operating systems. It includes a comprehensive
  implementation of the XenAPI, which encapsulates the configuration
  and deployment of VMs, storage and networking topologies across
  pools of physical hosts running XenServer.  The management
  tool-stack is written almost entirely in Objective Caml, and is one
  of the largest systems-level projects written in that language to
  date.</p>
<p>In this talk, we will firstly describe the architecture of
  XenServer and the XenAPI and discuss the challenges faced with
  implementing an Objective Caml based solution. These challenges
  range from the low-level concerns of interfacing with Xen and the
  Linux kernel, to the high-level algorithmic problems such as
  distributed failure planning. In addition, we will discuss the
  challenges imposed by using OCaml in a commercial environment, such
  as supporting product upgrades, enhancing supportability and scaling
  the development team.

  <b>Speaker:</b>
  <em>Howard Mansell</em>,
  <a href="http://www.credit-suisse.com/" target="_blank">Credit Suisse</a>
  <br>
  <b>Abstract:</b> Building valuation models for derivative trades
  requires rapid development of mathematical models, made possible by
  composition of lower-level model components.  We have found that F#,
  with the associated toolset, provides a unique combination of
  features that make it very well suited to this kind of development.
  In this talk, I will explain how we are using F# and show why it is
  a good match.  I will also talk about the problems we have had, and
  outline future enhancements that would benefit this kind of work.

  <b>Abstract:</b> 
  I will talk about my experience using (mostly) Haskell to design and
  implement the software infrastructure for a small trading group at
  Deutsche Bank. Most of the applications I write deal with such
  quotidian tasks as acquiring data from external sources, linking up
  related information from different sources, searching for specific
  patterns and making data available through a webserver. In addition
  to outlining my overall system architecture and highlighting some
  novel aspects of my implementation, I will discuss the various pros

  various immutable data structures that are composed based on the
  event streams.  I will also briefly touch on the Scala programming
  language and lift web framework.
</p>
<p>I will then discuss the experience of adding new team members to
  the project, the kind of defects in the application (hint: none are
  concurrency related), the experience of adding new features, and a
  general discussion of how well functional paradigms translate into a

The fifth workshop in the series taskesplace in Victoria, Canada on 26 September 2008, co-located with theInternational Conference on Functional Programming.  The workshop isgrowing rapidly, having started in Snowbird in 2004 with 25participants, increasing to 40 in Tallinn in 2005 and 57 in Portlandin 2006, and finally to 104 registered in 2007. We take this growth asevidence of a sea change in attitudes to functional programming: frombeing an academic pursuit, functional programming is rapidly becominga sought-after technology with increasingly broad applications.</p><!--<p>For the first time, this year's workshop received more offers ofpresentations than would fit in the available time. The eventualschedule included an invited talk by Xavier Leroy, eleven contributedpresentations, and an energetic concluding discussion led by Don Syme.Many of the slides for these presentations are available from the CUFPhome page (<a href="http://cufp.functionalprogramming.com"target="_blank">http://cufp.functionalprogramming.com</a>).</p><p>CUFP has traditionally had a scribe, who takes notes on thepresentations and then writes a summary of the event.  This year,Jeremy Gibbons took on that role, and we are very grateful to hisdiligence in both taking detailed notes and in writing a comprehensiveand enlightening summary.His <a href="http://cufp.functionalprogramming.com/CUFP-2007-Report.pdf"target="_blank"> report </a> is also available from the CUFP homepage.</p><p>This year, we also made a video recording of the presentations. Wewould like to thank Peter Thiemann and his students for providing theequipment, doing the recording, and post processing the raw footage.In the end, nine of the presenters opted to have their talks includedin the on-line collection.</p><p>The slides, videos, and written summary are all now available inthe ACM Digital Library, the first time this has been done forCUFP.</p><p>The next CUFP workshop will take place in Victoria, BritishColumbia, again co-located with ICFP, in September 2008.  We hope tosee you there!</p>-->     <p>       <b>Jim Grundy</b><br>       <b>Simon Peyton Jones</b><br>       <i>Co-Program Chairs</i><br>     </p>     <hr width="80%">     <p><em>26 September 2008</em></p>     </td>      <td class="side">&nbsp;</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="corner"><img src="../images/textBodyBL.gif"></td>      <td class="solid"></td>      <td class="corner"><img src="../images/textBodyBR.gif"></td>    </tr>  </table></body></html>

<p>Functional languages have been under academic development for over
25 years, and remain fertile ground for programming language research.
Recently, however, developers in industrial, governmental, and open
source projects have begun to use functional programming successfully
in practical applications.  In these settings, functional programming
has often provided dramatic leverage, including whole new ways of
thinking about the original problem.</p>

<p>The goal of the CUFP workshop is to act as a voice for these users
of functional programming.  The workshop supports the increasing
viability of functional programming in the commercial, governmental,
and open-source space by providing a forum for professionals to share
their experiences and ideas, whether those ideas are related to
business, management, or engineering. The workshop is also designed to
enable the formation and reinforcement of relationships that further
the commercial use of functional programming. Providing user feedback
to language designers and implementors is not a primary goal of the
workshop, though it will be welcome if it occurs.</p>

<a name="submit"><h3>Speaking at CUFP</h3></a>

<p>If you use functional programming as a means, rather than as an
end, we invite you to offer to give a talk at the workshop.
Alternatively, if you know someone who would give a good talk, please
nominate them!</p>

<p>Talks are typically 30 minutes long, but can be shorter.  They aim
to inform participants about how functional programming played out in
real-world applications, focusing especially on the re-usable lessons
learned, or insights gained.  Your talk does not need to be highly
technical; for this audience, reflections on the commercial,
management, or software engineering aspects are, if anything, more
important.  You do not need to submit a paper!</p>

<p>If you are interested in offering a talk, or nominating someone to
do so, send an e-mail to <i>jim (dot) d (dot) grundy (at) intel (dot)
com</i> or <i>simonpj (at) microsoft (dot) com</i> by <b>2 June
2008</b> with a short description of what you'd like to talk about or
what you think your nominee should give a talk about.  Such
descriptions should be about one page long.</p>

<h3>Program Plans</h3>

<p>CUFP 2008 will last a full day and feature an invited presentation,
presentations selected by the program committee, and discussion
sessions. Topics will range over a wide area, including:
<ul>
  <li> Case studies of successful and unsuccessful uses of functional
  programming;
  <li> Business opportunities and risks from using functional
  languages;
  <li> Enablers for functional language use in a commercial setting;
  <li> Barriers to the adoption of functional languages, and
  <li> Mitigation strategies for overcoming limitations of functional
    programming.
</ul>

There will be no published proceedings, as the meeting is intended to
be more a discussion forum than a technical interchange.</p>

     _________________________________________________________

   Functional languages have been under academic development for
   over 25 years, and remain fertile ground for programming
   language research. Recently, however, developers in industrial,
   governmental, and open-source projects have begun to use 
   functional programming successfully in practical applications. 
   In these settings, functional programming has often provided 
   dramatic leverage, including whole new ways of thinking about 
   the original problem.

   The goal of the CUFP workshop is to act as a voice for these
   users of functional programming. The workshop supports the
   increasing viability of functional programming in the
   commercial, governmental, and open-source space by providing a
   forum for professionals to share their experiences and ideas,
   whether those ideas are related to business, management, or
   engineering. The workshop is also designed to enable the
   formation and reinforcement of relationships that further the
   commercial use of functional programming. Providing user
   feedback to language designers and implementors is not a
   primary goal of the workshop, though it will be welcome if it
   occurs.

Speaking at CUFP

   If you use functional programming as a means, rather than as
   an end, we invite you to offer to give a talk at the workshop.
   Alternatively, if you know someone who would give a good talk,
   please nominate them!

   Talks are typically 25 minutes long, but can be shorter. They
   aim to inform participants about how functional programming
   played out in real-world applications, focusing especially on
   the re-usable lessons learned, or insights gained. Your talk
   does not need to be highly technical; for this audience,
   reflections on the commercial, management, or software
   engineering aspects are, if anything, more important. You do
   not need to submit a paper! Talks on the practical application
   of functional programming with a primarily technical focus may
   also be appropriate for the adjacent DEFUN 2009 event.

   If you are interested in offering a talk, or nominating someone 
   to do so, send an e-mail to francesco(at)erlang-consulting(dot)com
   or  jim(dot)d(dot)grundy(at)intel(dot)com by 15 May 2009 with a
   short description of what you'd like to talk about or what you
   think your nominee should give a talk about. Such descriptions
   should be about one page long.

Program Plans

   CUFP 2009 will last a full day and feature a keynote presentation 
   from Bryan O'Sullivan, co-author of Real World Haskell. The program 
   will also include a mix of presentations and discussion sessions. 
   Topics will range over a wide area, including:
     * Case studies of successful and unsuccessful uses of 
       functional programming;
     * Business opportunities and risks from using functional languages;
     * Enablers for functional language use in a commercial setting;
     * Barriers to the adoption of functional languages, and
     * Mitigation strategies for overcoming limitations of 
       functional programming.

   There will be no published proceedings, as the meeting is intended 
   to be more a discussion forum than a technical interchange.
   
   This will be the sixth CUFP, for more information - including
   reports from attendees of previous events and video of recent
   talks - see the workshop web site: http://cufp.galois.com/

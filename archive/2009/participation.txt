   Functional languages have been under academic development 
   for over 25 years, and remain fertile ground for programming
   language research. Recently, however, developers in industrial, 
   governmental, and open source projects have begun to use 
   functional programming successfully in practical applications. 
   In these settings, functional programming has often provided 
   dramatic leverage, including whole new ways of thinking about 
   the original problem.

   The goal of the CUFP workshop is to act as a voice for these
   users of functional programming. The workshop supports the
   increasing viability of functional programming in the
   commercial, governmental, and open-source space by providing a
   forum for professionals to share their experiences and ideas,
   whether those ideas are related to business, management, or
   engineering. The workshop is also designed to enable the
   formation and reinforcement of relationships that further
   the commercial use of functional programming. Providing user
   feedback to language designers and implementors is not a
   primary goal of the workshop, though it will be welcome if it
   occurs.

   There will be no published proceedings, as the meeting is
   intended to be more a discussion forum than a technical
   interchange.

   See http://cufp.galois.com for more information, including
   presentation abstracts and the most recent schedule
   information.
   
   This will be the sixth CUFP; see CUFP 2004 CUFP 2005, CUFP
   2006, CUFP 2007 and CUFP 2008 for information about the
   earlier meetings, including reports from attendees and video
   of the most recent talks.
